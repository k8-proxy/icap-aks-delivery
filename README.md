### Tarball for ICAP Images

The tarball called ```_images.tgz``` will be provided by Glasswall Solutions and steps on how to utilise this will be section 4.1

## 2. Usage

### 2.1 Clone Repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/k8-proxy/icap-aks-delivery.git
cd icap-aks-delivery
git submodule init
git submodule update

```
### Pre-requisite healthcheck.

```
./scripts/healthchecks/pre_requisite_healtcheck.sh

```
   
### 2.2 Firstly make sure you are logged in and using the correct subscription.

```bash

az login
az account list --output table
az account set -s <subscription ID>

# Confirm you are on correct subscription
az account show

```

### 2.3. Add required credentails.

- All the required secrets and variables are listed in  are ".env.example".

- Run below

```
cp .env.example .env
vim .env
```

- Enter required values for all variables (REGION - any Azure region, RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME, STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME - accepts just small letters and numbers, CONTAINER_NAME, TAGS, VAULT_NAME, DH_SA_USERNAME, DH_SA_PASSWORD, SmtpUser, SmtpPass, token_username="policy-management")
- Run

```
export $(xargs<.env)
```
### 2.4 Create azure initial setup

- Run below script

```     
source ./scripts/terraform-scripts/create_azure_setup.sh

```
**Important** : Please update DH_SA_USERNAME, DH_SA_PASSWORD to .env file, this is principal service ID and password which use to repositories image download

### 2.5 Add Terraform Backend Key to Environment

- Check if you have access to keyvault using below command where $VAULT_NAME is output value from step 2.4
```
az keyvault secret show --name terraform-backend-key --vault-name $VAULT_NAME --query value -o tsv
```
- Export the environment variable "ARM_ACCESS_KEY" to be able to initialise terraform

```
export ARM_ACCESS_KEY=$(az keyvault secret show --name terraform-backend-key --vault-name $VAULT_NAME --query value -o tsv)
```
 
- Check if you can access ARM_ACCESS_KEY as variable
```
echo $ARM_ACCESS_KEY
```
- In case setup healthcheck returns any errors, fix them before proceeding

### 2.6 Azure setup Healthcheck 

```
./scripts/healthchecks/azure_setup_healthcheck.sh

```

### 2.7 Add Secrets to main KeyVault 

#### Credentials for Azure Container Registry

Before running this script please make sure you add your service principle ```clientID``` and ```clientSecret``` has been added to the ```.env``` before running the script below. You need to add it to the ```DH_SA_USERNAME``` and ```DH_SA_PASSWORD``` fields:

- Once you've added the service principle credentials to the ```.env``` you will need to run the below again:

```
export $(xargs<.env)
```

- Then run below script

```
./scripts/terraform-scripts/load_keyvault_secrets.sh
```

### 2.8 File Modifications

- backend.tfvars - this will be used as azure backend to store deployment state. Run below script

```
./scripts/terraform-scripts/setup_backend_config.sh
```

- terraform.tfvars

```
vim terraform.tfvars

# give a valid region name
azure_region="UKWEST"

# give a short suffix, maximum of 3 character.
suffix="stg"

```

### 3 Creating SSL Certs

#### Self signed quick start

**For evaluation use we have provided scripts to generate and apply self signed certificates**

- Open terraform.tfvars
```
vim terraform.tfvars

```
- Set flag `enable_cutomser_cert` as `false`. The self signed cdertificate will be generated and configured automatically during deployment.

#### Customer Certificates

**If you have your own certificates for production use then follow below steps**
- Run below
```
mkdir -p certs/mgmt-cert
mkdir -p certs/icap-cert
mkdir -p certs/file-drop-cert
```
- There will be three set of certificates needed. Please follow below procedure 

- Replace suffix in below domain names while generating actual certificates for domains. You should be having three set of certificates once generating certificates.

|  Name         | Domain Name |
|------         |---------    |
| icap-client   | icap-${suffix}.ukwest.cloudapp.azure.com   |
| management-ui | management-ui-${suffix}.{domain} |
| file-drop     | file-drop-${suffix}.{domain}     |

- Rename `.crt` file to certificate.crt and `.key` file to `tls.key` for all domain certificates

- Copy `icap-client certificates` to `certs/icap-cert`

- Copy `file-drop certificates` to  `certs/file-drop-cert`

- Copy `management-ui certificates` to  `certs/mgmt-cert`

- Set flag `enable_cutomser_cert` to `true` in `terraform.tfvars` which takes above certificate during deployment

## 4. Pre deployment

### 4.1 Pushing images to ACR

So as mentioned in the pre-reqs Glasswall will provide a Tarball with all the images needed for the ICAP Services. These images will need to be added to the newly created ACR and the location of the images will then need to updated in the icap-adaptation helm charts.

In order to do this you will need to make sure the ```_images.tgz``` package is in the directory ```./scripts/push-images/```. Then you would need to run the following script followed by the URL of the Azure Container Registry created in previous steps.

```
cd /script/push-images/

./push_images.sh <ACR NAME HERE>
```

This will then kick start the process off uploading the images to the newly created keyvault. This can take up to an hour to complete (depending on your upload speed) and whilst it is completing we can move onto the next section.

### 4.2 Adding the registry to values

This section we will cover adding the newly created Azure Container Registry details to the ```values.yaml```. Within each Helm chart there is a ```values.yaml``` file and inside there is an value called ```imagestore:```. Each of these values point to the images need to create each of the individual Icap Services. 

So in order to make sure we are adding the correct registry into the ```values.yaml`` we need to run the following script followed by the full URL for the Azure Container Registry:

Firstly
```
cp ./scripts/k8_scripts/update-registry-values.sh ./charts/icap-infrastructure
```
Then
```
cd ./charts/icap-infrastructure
```
Now run the script
```
./update-registry-values.sh $CONTAINER_REGISTRY_NAME.azurecr.io/
```
***It's important you do not forget the ```/``` off the end of the registry name, as this will cause issues pulling the image from the ACR***

All of the registry values with in ```values.yaml``` will have been updated to the ACR we created earlier in the steps.

### 4.3 ICAP Port customization
- By default icap-server will run on port 1344 for SSL and 1345 for TLS
- If you want to customize the above port, please follow below procedure
```
vim terraform.tfvars
```
- Edit variables `icap_port` and `icap_tlsport` according to requirement and Save it.

Note : Please avoide port 80, 443 since this will be used for file-drop UI.

## 5. Deployment
### 5.1 Setup and Initialise Terraform

- Run following:
```
terraform init -backend-config="backend.tfvars" 

```
- Run terraform validate/refresh to check for changes within the state, and also to make sure there aren't any issues.
```
terraform validate

#Output should be: Success! The configuration is valid.
```

-Run
```
terraform plan
```

- Now you're ready to run apply
``` 
terraform apply 

# You will get below output. Make sure to enter YES when prompt
Do you want to perform these actions?
Terraform will perform the actions described above.
Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.
Enter a value: 
Enter "yes"
```

## 6. Testing the solution.

### 6.1 Testing rebuild 

Run ICAP client locally

1. Find DNS of the ICAP-Server and Management UI

- Icap-server

    Run below command and switch to aks cluster by replacing `${suffix}` below
    ```
     kubectl config get-contexts
  
     kubectl config use-context  aks-clu-${suffix}
     kubectl get service  --all-namespaces
  
    ```

    - ICAP-server : EXTERNAL-IP of frontend-icap-lb 
    - Management-ui : EXTERNAL-IP of ingress-nginx-controller
    
- Management-ui: 
    ```
    kubectl get ingress -A
    
    ```
    
- File-Drop    

     Run below command and switch to file-drop cluster by replacing `${suffix}` below
  ```
     kubectl config get-contexts
  
     kubectl config use-context  fd-clu-${suffix}
     kubectl get ingress -A
  ```
     
2. Run:

        git clone https://github.com/k8-proxy/icap-client-docker.git
    
3. Run: 

        cd icap-client-docker/
        sudo docker build -t c-icap-client .
    
4. Run: 
       
        ./icap-client.sh {IP of frontend-icap-lb} JS_Siemens.pdf
        
        (check Respond Headers: HTTP/1.0 200 OK to verify rebuild is successful)
    
5. Run: 

        open rebuilt/rebuilt-file.pdf  
    
       (and notice "Glasswall Proccessed" watermark on the right hand side of the page)
    
6. Open original `./JS_Siemens.pdf` file in Adobe reader and notice the Javascript and the embedded file 
7. Open `https://file-drop.co.uk/` or `https://glasswall-desktop.com/` and drop both files (`./JS_Siemens.pdf ( original )` and `rebuilt/rebuilt-file.pdf (rebuilt) `) and compare the differences

### 7 Uninstall AKS-Solution

#### **Only if you want to uninstall AKS solution completely from your system, then proceed**

- Run below script to destroy all cluster ,resources, keyvaults,storage containers and service principal.

```
./scripts/terraform-scripts/uninstall_icap_aks_setup.sh
```
